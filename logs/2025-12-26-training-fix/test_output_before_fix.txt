Step 1: loss = 10.802672
Step 2: loss = 10.802672
Step 3: loss = 10.802672
Step 4: loss = 10.802672
Step 5: loss = 10.802672
Warning: Loss didn't decrease: 10.802672 -> 10.802672
Training loop test PASSED

==================================================
ALL TESTS PASSED

# NOTE: Loss is EXACTLY the same for all 5 steps
# This proves weights are not being updated
# Root cause: gradient buffers have offset=0, so SGD updates nothing
